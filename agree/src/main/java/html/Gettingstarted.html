<h1>Getting started </h1>

<h2>Loading schema/STEP file</h2>
<p>Load a schema from "File"->"Load schema" or open an existing STEP file, "File" -> "Import STEP". 
AP-schemas are parsed in advance and thus faster to load. </p>

<h2>Giz files </h2>
<p>AGREE files are saved with the file extension *.giz. Thus files created in Eurosteps Graphical Instance can
be opened in AGREE. </p>

<h2>Creating entity instances</h2>
<p>Entity instances are created by "drag-and-drop" from the entities in the loaded schema.</p>
