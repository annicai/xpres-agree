<h1>Edit attributes</h1>

<h2>String/Integer/Double</h2>
<p>To edit a value attribute, double-click on the attribute in the instance box and type a new value. </p>

<h2>Entities</h2>
<p> Click on the corresponding button in the instance box. Drag existing instances from the left table to the right (green)
to add the entity to the attribute and from the right to the left to remove it.
<br>New entities are created by dragging them from the entity tree in the "New instances"-tab.
<br>The shown existing instance matches can be filtered by choosing an entity class in the "Filter"-tab. The instances can
also be filtered by their (string) attribute values. </p>
