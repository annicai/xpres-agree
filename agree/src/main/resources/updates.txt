2013-05-23

*	Fixed bug with some entities not being visible in the tree. (Ex: Event_occurrence_role)

*	List of lists improved. Entities belonging to the same list will have a common anchor. The list number is also displayed.

*	Undo/Redo functionality extended to include compound action such as horizontal alignment of a set of boxes.

2013-04-18

* 	Undo/Redo (CTRL Z/CTRL Y) functionality. Works with changes done on the canvas (typing string attributes, "Draw relationship", 
	location changes etc).

* 	Added status-bar. "Loading schema"-popup removed. 

* 	List of lists (of lists etc) working with basic functionality.
	Right now the connections are displayed (but only as ordinary connections, no information is shown about which of the lists they belong to). 
	Entities can be added/removed from aggregates of aggregates. They will however always be added to the first aggregate in the list of aggregates.
	Some way to choose which of the lists to use need to be implemented.  

2013-03-21

	left_wheel_occurrence = #8;
	ENDSEC;

	REFERENCE;
	#1 = <context.stp#mechanical_product_context>;
	#2 = <context.stp#design_product_definition>;
	#3 = <wheel.stp#wheel_definition>;
	ENDSEC;

*	Files with multiple data sections show one active section at a time with the possibility of switching between them.

2013-01-31

	Ex: Applied_event_occurence_assignment could not be assigned a role since Event_occurence_role had not been 
	associated with the schema.

* 	Fixed bug with some abstract entities as top nodes in short form schemas.
	Ex: Abs_function - Operand.	
	
* 	Fixed problem with Booleans.

*	New layout for A_double/A_interger/A_string in "Edit relationships".
	Ex: Cartesian_point - Coordinates
